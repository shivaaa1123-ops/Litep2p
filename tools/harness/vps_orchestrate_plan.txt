WAN multi-node test plan (copy/paste friendly)

Prereqs:
- India VPS already running signaling+TURN (per config.json).
- Two peer VPS: Singapore + US.
- Repo checked out on both peer VPS (same commit) and `config.json` points at India signaling+TURN.

Step 1 (on Singapore VPS):
  PEER_ID=peer-sg PEER_PORT=30001 sudo bash tools/harness/vps_bootstrap_and_run.sh

Step 2 (on US VPS):
  PEER_ID=peer-us PEER_PORT=30001 sudo bash tools/harness/vps_bootstrap_and_run.sh

Step 3 (optional) netem stress on one peer VPS (example: add loss/jitter for 10 minutes):
  # install tc is already done by bootstrap
  sudo tc qdisc replace dev eth0 root netem loss 5% delay 200ms 50ms distribution normal
  # later reset:
  sudo tc qdisc del dev eth0 root || true

Step 4 (connectivity assertions)
Run the peer binaries with CLI / admin commands (depends on your current CLI commands) to:
- ensure both peers REGISTER to signaling
- list peers
- connect peer-sg <-> peer-us
- validate CONNECT_SUCCESS and that we never remain CONNECTING/HANDSHAKING beyond watchdog timeouts

Artifacts to collect after each run:
- tools/harness/vps_peer_peer-sg.log
- tools/harness/vps_peer_peer-us.log
- tools/harness/vps_session_manager_test.log (should be PASS)
